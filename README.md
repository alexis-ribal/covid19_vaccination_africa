# COVID-19 vaccination in sub-Saharan Africa

The distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has been disproportionate in the World.  While some high-income countries are getting most of the doses, low and lower-middle income countries - many of them in sub-Saharan Africa have received a smaller amount.  It is important to note that thanks to the COVAX initiative, many sub-Saharan African Countries have been able to start getting doses since February 2021.  

The purpose of this dataset is to record and track the number of doses delivered to sub-Saharan African countries on a weekly basis.  While half of these countries have recived doses through the COVAX initiative, others have received them from other donors, including China, Russia and China.  We try to capture all kind of doses received but there is a high chance that we are missing some deliveries.  We mostly rely on official sources, such as the UN and government portals, but also on news agencies that announce these deliveries and mention government agencies involved.

Disclaimer: although we do an exhaustive search, these numbers might underreport the real number of doses that sub-Saharan African countries have received.  If you know about a delivery of COVID-19 vaccine doses not recorded here or if you think there is a mistake, please send an email to alexis.rivera.b@gmail.com
